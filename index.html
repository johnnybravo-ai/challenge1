  <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,

  <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
     who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
     and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
     weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
     the course, I’ve successfully
    switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

  <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

<div class="par5">
  <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
    I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
    step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by
     a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
      The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and
       I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
        was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
        of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
